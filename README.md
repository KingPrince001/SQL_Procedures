# Procedures in SQL

Procedures in SQL are a powerful feature that allows you to encapsulate and reuse SQL code. They enhance code modularity, reusability, and security. In this presentation, we will explore various aspects of procedures in the context of a shoe company database scenario.

## Creating a Procedure

To create a procedure in SQL, use the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. Here's an example of a procedure that retrieves shoes by color:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetShoesByColor (@color VARCHAR(50))
AS
BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM Shoes WHERE Color = @color;
END;
